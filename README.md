- ResNet50 has a accuracy of 46.31% on completely un-seen data.
- ResNet18 has a accuracy of 52.63% on completely un-seen data.

Remarks: The model will perform well on un-seen data, if we will provide a good amount of train dataset to the model. 
         The augmentation method is incressing the size of data set, but they generated images are similar, resulting "Overfitting".
